# creyol's guide to the game

## part one
    here is your guide on part one to the game (be sure to leave a like and subscribe)

### points
    you get points every 3 seconds
    the amount can be boosted by atoms if you have any

### scientifically inaccurate atoms
    atoms can be found by clicking the giant atom button
    atoms increase point gain by +1% (whatever that means)
    they cap out at 50 though maybe try doing something to fix that

### reset theory
    atom resets are pretty much just resets that increase the atom limit
    they also increase the atom boost by +1% (again)
    you need max atoms to do it though
    do as many as possible to maximise point gain

## part two
    here is your guide on part two to the game (1 subscriber special)

### acceleration
    accelerate to decrease the aforementioned point interval by 10%
    this one is not additive sorry
    you lose maybe most of your points when you accelerate
    but you also get +50% atoms though

### construction
    no more clicking (yay)
    create stuff using atoms to speed things up
